* Fixed immutability of encryption/hashing algorithms (sharing of same Cipher/Digest instance)

Version 1.5
* Changed CombineAlgorithm interface, added SplitAlgorithm and CombineSplitAlgorithm interfaces
* Added input checks in all builders
* Fixed DigestAlgorithmBuilder.salted(CombineAlgorithm) builder method
* Changed inner structure of builders and repackaging of inner classes
* Few javadoc updates (misspelling...etc.)

Version 1.4
* Slightly improved performance of hashing algorithms
* Added SaltedHashingAlgorithm interface that is implemented by SaltingAdapter

Version 1.3
* Fixed bytes representation for salting adapter
* Removed encoding for salting adapter builder (uses encoding of adapted algorithm)

Version 1.2
* Added BytesRepresentation and incorporated into both hashing and encryption algorithms

Version 1.1
* Added SecureProperties that extend java.util.Properties and allow storing/reading encrypted properties
* Added possibility to add salting to repeating decorator
